### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Google. I enjoy exploring and experimenting with open source projects, and potentially contributing to them.

I have developed backend modules using programming languages Java, C++, Python. I am familiar with front end Javascript frameworks like Angular2, feel free to reach me out at dineshsandadi@gmail.com if you have an opensource project and looking for contributors.

Fun fact: I'm currently leanring Machine Learning.
